# dotfiles
My dotfiles.

Only supports Linux.

## Usage
You must have git and zsh installed.

**Installing WILL remove your old .zshrc! Move it if you want to keep it!**
```bash
# install, you can also update the same way
# updating will destroy any of your changes though
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thesbros/dotfiles/master/bin/install | zsh
```

## Aliases
